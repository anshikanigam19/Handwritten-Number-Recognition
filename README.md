This project demonstrates the implementation of a Handwritten Number Recognition system using Python. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on the popular MNIST dataset.

DATASET

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).
